\title{Audio Steganography}

	\maketitle
	\begin{abstract}
		Digital Multimedia files such as images, videos, audio files etc. became ubiquitous in our lives. We can leverage these multimedia files for communication. Steganography is a technique for hiding information in these files in an imperceptible manner. By manipulating the multimedia signals, one can transmit messages to another in such a way that original signal would be indistinguishable from the manipulated one by a human. This paper demonstrates an application of audio steganography using MATLAB.
